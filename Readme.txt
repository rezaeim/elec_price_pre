Notes:

- The original file is very massive, sending it by email was not reasonable. So, I removed the raw data.

- This folder includes the processedÂ data which is needed to run the model.

- Code part has two parts:

	- Data (data acquisition): There is no need to download the data again, however, the codes of data acquisition are included.

	- Model (model training, prediction, and evaluation)

- The Jupiter files have step-by-step comments.
